    <p id="quote" class="info">"Taylor Swift's seventh track on evermore is supposedly a hindsight about the Scott and Scooter Braun scandle she had been through over the making of the album. In this song she elaborates on how she had been feeling about the lawsuit and the robbery of her masters. It is one of the most personal and mature songs in the album, and that's why it's place has been guarded in this Top 3."</p>
